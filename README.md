# Unity Number Wizard v1

I made the very simple version of Number Wizard Console Game .
This game makes you pick a number between 1 and 1000 and tries to guess the number you've picked by asking you some questions .
This version of the game uses binary searching algorithm to guess your number .
This game can know if you cheated . So be fair :)
I'm looking forward to add more fun features and more flexibility with volume 2 . 

Game language is Turkish .
